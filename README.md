## Development

It begins with selecting a random text for the player to type, then initiates a 60-second countdown timer once the game starts. As players type, their input is compared against the provided text, with visual feedback indicating accuracy. Correctly typed characters are highlighted in green, while errors are shown in red. The script also counts the number of correctly typed words and characters, updating these metrics in real-time on the screen. Event listeners on the keyboard detect typing and backspace actions, ensuring responsive gameplay. The game ends when the timer runs out, with the option to restart and try a new text.
